#### Exercise ####

# =================================================-



#### Task 1 ####



# Add 3 and 5.

# Add -10.56 and 99.679



# Result:







#================================================

#### Task 2 ####



# Subtract 67 from 666.

# Subtract -67 from 89.



# Result:







#================================================

#### Task 3 ####



# Multiply 555 by 444.

# Multiply -5.5 by 0.32.



# Result:





#================================================

#### Task 4 ####



# Divide 20 by 65.

# Divide 0.333 by 0.999.



# Result:







#================================================

#### Task 5 ####



# Take the square root of 125.

# Take the square root of the product of 64 and 8.

# Take the square root of a -9.



# Result:







# What do you get in return? Why do you think you got this as the output?





#================================================

#### Task 6 ####

# Raise 6 to the 10th power.

# Raise a sum of 95 and -7 to the 3rd power.



# Result:











#================================================

#### Bonus question ####

# Take the cube root of 1000



# Result: 







# Why does this work?







#================================================

#### Task 7 ####



# What is the remainder when we divide 5 by 2?

# What is the remainder when we divide 6 by 7?

# How many times can we fit 8 into 999?

# What is the biggest integer we get if we divide 24 by -12?



# Result: 













#================================================

#### Task 8 ####



# Make a variable called `var_1` and let it be equal to a sum of 100 and 65.

# Make a variable called `var_2` and let it be equal a product of 3 and 1/2.

# Hint: when you create a new variable, make sure you view what it is equal to 

# in console and / or environment pane.



# Result:





#================================================

#### Task 9 ####



# Make a variable called `var_3`, which is a result of division of `var_1` by `var_2`.

# Make a variable called `var_4` and set it equal to 110.



# Result:





#================================================

#### Task 10 ####



# Compare `var_4` to `var_3`. Are they equal?

# Compare `var_1` to `var_4`. Is `var_4` greater than `var_1`?

# Compare `var_1` to `var_2`. Is `var_1` greater than `var_2`?

# Compare `var_2` to `var_3`. Is `var_2` at least as big as `var_3`?

# Compare `var_4` to `var_3`. Is `var_4` at most as big as `var_3`?



# Result:













#================================================

#### Task 11 ####



# Make a variable called `temp_var` and set it equal to 10^3.

# Divide it by 10 and save it to itself. What is `temp_var` now equal to?

# Can we retrieve the initial value of `temp_var`?



# Result:







#================================================

#### Task 12 ####



# Make a variable `Temp_Var` and assign it to the negative third power of 5.

# Can we still retrieve the value assigned to `temp_var`? If yes, then what is it?



# Result: 







#================================================

#### Bonus question 1 ####



# How many different remainders can we get from dividing any number by 2?



# Result: 





# What are they?





# Why is that?





#================================================

#### Bonus question 2 ####

# Out of all possible pairs of the 4 variables (`var_1` through `var_4`), find the one with the biggest sum!

# Assign that sum to `var_5`.



# Result: 

# There are 6 possible combinations of 4 variables, i.e. 6 sums:













# There are 2 pairs that produce the same result:







# We can make `var_5` be equal to either 



# or 



# You could also get to the correct result by comparing variables individually and picking

# the two largest variable  out of 4, because they will produce the biggest sum.



# Pick the 1st largest variable first:



# Compare var_1 to var_2 (we need to use >= instead of >, because > will 

# return FALSE in case the two variables are the same, >= will return TRUE and keeping 

# either of the two will be fine)



# Since `var_1` is greater than or equal to `var_2`, we'll keep `var_1`, and compare it to `var_3`.



# Since `var_1` is greater than or equal to `var_3`, we'll keep `var_1`, and compare it to `var_4`.



# Seems like `var_1` is the 1st biggest variable of 4, this will be the first number in our sum.



# Now let's pick the second biggest (exclude `var_1`):



# Since `var_3` is bigger than or equal to `var_3`, keep it and compare it to `var_4`



# Since `var_3` is bigger than or equal to `var_4`, the 2nd biggest number is `var_3`, so the sum will be
